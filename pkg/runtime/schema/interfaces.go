// All objects that are serialized from a Scheme encode their type information. This interface is used
// by serialization to set type information from the Scheme onto the serialized version of an object.
// For objects that cannot be serialized or have unique requirements, this interface may be a no-op.

	// SetGroupVersionKind sets or clears the intended serialized kind of an object. Passing kind nil
	// should clear the current setting.
	SetGroupVersionKind(kind GroupVersionKind)
	// GroupVersionKind returns the stored group, version, and kind of an object, or an empty struct
	// if the object does not expose or provide these fields.
